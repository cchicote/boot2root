We need to spam the "shift" key at the boot of the vm. (the "escape" key also works)
We see a message: "boot: ". It is the prompt of GRUB2.
When we spam the "tab" key for autocompletion it gives us the "live" command.

When we write it and press enter, it just boot on our OS without any root access.

So after some research, we needed to spam GRUB2 menu to modify boot entry and appending "init=/bin/sh" to the end of the line beginning with: linux...

But after a lot of time, we wasn't able to spam GRUB2 menu, so we just tried to make this command by adding "init=/bin/sh" to live:
live init=/bin/sh
or
live init=/bin/bash

It works well, we have our terminal and we are root ! Congrats :D
