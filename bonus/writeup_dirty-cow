After getting access to user laurie,
we can easly get access to the kernel linux version: uname -r
- 3.2.0-91-generic-pae

After some reseach, we see that there is a race-condition vulnerability named "dirty cow" (CoW for copy-on-write).
It gives us access to write whatever we want on any file of the system

So we download the exploit: https://github.com/artemgurzhii/dirty-cow-root-exploit
(I just wrote an other, easier to use)

We compile it and use it.
It asks us to choose a password.
type it, press enter
wait, until it is over, if it is too long, just ctrl+C the program.

And now you can use:
su root
type the password that you choose before.

Now it is working, we are root.
